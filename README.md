## The Story: Order from Chaos

This tool was born from a real-world necessity. As a Cyber Security Engineer managing SIEM systems with hundreds, or even thousands, of log sources, I frequently faced a persistent problem: **inconsistent, chaotic, and meaningless log source names.**

When a new naming standard was established within the organization, manually renaming hundreds of sources was a slow, tedious, and extremely error-prone process. Names like `ACME_FW_LOGS`, `acme-firewall`, or `FirewallACME` not only slowed down analysis but also made automation nearly impossible.

**Log Source Namer** was designed to bring an end to this chaos. Its purpose is to automate complex, rule-based naming standards to generate consistent, meaningful, and error-free names in seconds. This small tool started with the idea of turning a task that could take hours into an enjoyable one.

## What Can It Do? ‚úÖ

This is not just a simple text joiner; it's an advanced naming engine:

- **Dynamic Fields:** Define as many input fields as you need, such as `Hostname`, `Customer`, or `IPAddress`.
- **Smart Template Builder:** Freely construct your template using static text (like `FW-` or `_LOGS`) and your dynamic fields.
- **Atomic Processors:** Apply transformation rules to each field independently:
  - **Cleanup:** Automatically trim leading and trailing whitespace.
  - **Casing:** Choose from a variety of casing options, including `UPPERCASE`, `lowercase`, `Title Case`, and true `Sentence case.`
  - **Word Joining:** Keep spaces between words or join them using `snake_case`, `kebab-case`, `dot.case`, or `camelCase`.
- **Client-Side Storage:** Your entire complex configuration is securely saved in your browser's local storage. Your settings are preserved even when you refresh or close the page.
- **Clean Interface:** The usage and settings views are separate, eliminating clutter from your daily workflow.

## How to Use üöÄ

1.  Click the gear icon **`‚öôÔ∏è`** on the main screen to open the **Settings** panel.
2.  In the **Fields & Processors** section, create the fields you need and define rules like `Casing` and `Word Joining` for each.
3.  In the **Smart Template Builder** section, construct your final name template using clickable field pills and static text.
4.  Click **"Save & Close"** to save your configuration.
5.  You can now instantly generate and copy standard-compliant names using the form on the main screen!
